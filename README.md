Save your favorite recipes from all over the web, and easily create shopping lists for them in Todoist.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)-powered front end for [Recipe-App-Backend](https://github.com/joshuaalexanderio/recipe-app-backend/). That project is a dependency for this one.

## Getting Started

First, install all dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Second, copy .env.example to .env, and .env.local.example to .env.local. Fill out all details for both files.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
